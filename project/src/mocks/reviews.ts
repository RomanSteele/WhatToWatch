This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.","date":"2023-07-20T07:05:34.295Z"},

  "comment":"The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. ",
